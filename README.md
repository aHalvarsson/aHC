### My Codecademy projects


**Hello and welcome!**


Here you will find the different tasks I'm given while studying fullstack web development at Codecademy.
These projects/tasks are only used privately for my own development.
I put them here on Github only to get feedback and learn more but also to show what I can do.

Please feel free to give feedback, tips and tricks or just write a line to say hi.


Regards
Anders
